Simulated 3-axis spacecraft attitude motion using quaternion kinematics, RK4 integration, magnetic B-dot detumbling, and aerodynamic torque modeling. Created as part of AE 403 – Spacecraft Attitude Control at UIUC.

Includes:
- Quaternion-based kinematics
- RK4 rotational dynamics
- B-dot magnetic detumbling controller
- Aerodynamic disturbance torques
- 3D attitude visualization and angular velocity plots
